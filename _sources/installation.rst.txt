Installation
---------------

The easiest way to install the stable version from the Python Package
Index (PyPI) is using the official, built-in Python package manager,
``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    pip install qml --user -U

Alternatively, you can install the most recent stable development
snapshot directly from GitHub:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/qmlcode/qml --user -U


For more installation help, please see the github repository: https://github.com/qmlcode/qml/
